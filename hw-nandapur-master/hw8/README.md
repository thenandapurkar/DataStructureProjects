Code compiles fine when typing: 
                                qmake
                                make

Problem 1 is located in:
Hw8Problem1_1.pdf
Hw8Problem1_2.pdf
Hw8Problem1_3.pdf

Everything should be in there to be able to run the code.  Fixed the problem in HW 5 as well by adding a warning box when trying to add a user that does not exist...(Includes extra spaces and such).
